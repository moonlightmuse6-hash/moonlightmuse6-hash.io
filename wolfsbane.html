          <h1>Wolfsbane: The Wolf’s Bane (and Yours Too) </h1>
          <p>
            With its striking hooded purple flowers, wolfsbane (Aconitum spp.) looks like it's from a dark fairy tale and for good reason.
             This infamous plant, also called "monkshood" or "devil’s helmet," is laced with aconitine, one of nature’s most potent neurotoxins. 
             Just brushing against it can cause numbness, while ingestion leads to violent vomiting, heart arrhythmias, and paralysis, often with fatal results.

Ancient warriors used it to poison arrows, and werewolf legends warn of its power. 
Today? It’s a gorgeous but grim reminder: some beauty is best admired at arm’s length.
