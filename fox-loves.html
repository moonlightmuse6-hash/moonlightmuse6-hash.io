          <h1>Foxglove: A Deadly Delight </h1>
          <p>
            With its towering spikes of bell-shaped blooms, foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) adds fairytale charm to gardens—but hiding behind its beauty is a heart-stopping secret.
             Every part of this plant contains digitalis glycosides, potent compounds that can dangerously slow or disrupt the heartbeat.

Even small amounts cause nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and irregular pulse—symptoms that mimic a witch’s curse. 
Ironically, its toxins are used in life-saving heart medications, but in nature, this plant plays for keeps.
 Best to admire its whimsy with your eyes, not your hands (or mouth)!
